# What is a front-end

** A frontend is the part of your website that faces internet users,
i.e. your customers. The back-end is a place that is only accessible
for you, where you can administer the whole (or part of the) e-commerce 
process. **

> Technologies such as Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby.JS, and Next.JS are usually 
used to power sophisticated websites that are looking to improve their 
speed to secure a better ranking. Since Gatsby.JS and Next.JS are at the 
forefront of these technologies, the debate surrounding them is more 
nuanced than the rest.

## Gatsbyjs

> The main thing that you should know about choosing GatsbyJS is that it 
has a major problem with its buildup time. Perhaps, the experimental 
incremental build feature can help to resolve this problem. In the 
meantime, if you don't have a lot of authors and content that needs to 
be published, then this is the site generator that you can rely on.

## Nextjs

> If the aim of the website that you're building is for it to grow 
exponentially, then this is the site generator framework that you should 
opt for. You can have the best of both worlds with server-side rendering 
and static site generation. This means that you can always export your 
site's HTML pages to suit your needs. 

> In addition, you should have access to scalability features that should 
help you to determine the growth and reach that your site is achieving. 
This is one of the most useful SEO features that you'll have access to. 
However, it goes without saying that to get the desired performance from 
your NextJS, you should have a powerful server. This way, it can process 
any sized file for enhanced performance.

## Gatsby vs. Nextjs

Gatsbyjs makes its own analysis: [https://www.gatsbyjs.com/features/jamstack/gatsby-vs-nextjs]
(https://www.gatsbyjs.com/features/jamstack/gatsby-vs-nextjs). They may
be somewhat biassed.

Another great article on the comparison between Gatsbyjs and Nextjs can 
be found on [https://isotropic.co/gatsbyjs-vs-nextjs/]
(https://isotropic.co/gatsbyjs-vs-nextjs/).

As a general rule we love Nextjs for bigger projects. In some ways Nextjs is
also easier to work with. Gatsbyjs is better for smaller projects and 
especially when one of the templates provided by Gatsby, or the Gatsby
community is a good fit for your use case. We used Gatsbyjs for our
this documentation website, and also for the [shoppingstreet.io landingpage]
(https://www.shoppingstreet.io).
