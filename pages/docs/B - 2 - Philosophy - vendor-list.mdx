# Vendor list

## Introduction

** As we use the services of specialists, we tend to use third-party
vendor services for almost everything. Some are optional, for some 
we provide limited options, and we always welcome suggestions! **

## What we (almost) always use

In the product configuration section on our 
[shoppingstreet.io](https://www.shoppingingstreet.io) landingpage we
provide a list of limited options for setting up a template webshop.

**For your backend, either:**

1. [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com)
2. [BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com)
3. [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-gb-nl)
4. [Commercejs](https://commercejs.com)
5. [Saleor](https://saleor.io/)
6. [Swell](https://www.swell.is)

**For your front-end, either:**

1. [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/use-cases/e-commerce/)
2. [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/commerce)
3. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)

**For deploying your front-end, either:**

1. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
2. [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

**For optional features:**

* [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) or [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com)
(Newsletters, and campaigns)
* [Legal Reaction LLC](https://react.legal), our sister firm for legal 
advice, terms, and other legal documents
* We have a network of:
  * designers for brands, and brandstyles,
  * frontend specialists, with knowledge of CSS, svg, and any other 
  technique for designing webgraphics.
  * photoshop artists

With regard to brand design, if your use case is less demanding you can 
opt for solutions like [brandmark.io](https://brandmark.io).

### What we also use: ###

Features in webshops developed by us are powered by third-party vendors:

1. [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for our customer login
2. [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) for content for blogposts and
other data
3. [Strapi.io](https://strapi.io) for any custom backend solution 
(Database + API)

*inter alia* your website
5. [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) automation and backend for landingpages
6. Chat with your customers, [Crisp](https://crisp.chat/en/), 
[Tidio](https://www.tidio.com) en [Slack](https://slack.com)

### What we use for development: ###

1. [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) which is a front-end component library
2. [Tailwind CCS](https://tailwindcss.com/) which is a styling library
3. [Slack](https://slack.com/) for direct communication with our customer
4. [Asana](https://asana.com) managing tasks for development

## The list goes on...

We are not biased towards software. We have no relations with any of the
chosen technologies, i.e. vendors. We are always open for new suggestions.
We always seek improvements and it is our biggest fear to miss the next 
big thing that will help our customers!
