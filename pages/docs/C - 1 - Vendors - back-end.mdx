# What is the back-end

**A webshop has a front-end and a back-end. The front-end is the side of 
your website that is facing your customers. Your customers see a visually
well thought out view of your products. Where they can search, filter,
sort, and buy your products. A back-end is the part of the shop the customer
does not see. This is where you manage your products. Where you can update
prices and where you can add information about your products.**

## Shopify

We would only recommend using Shopify in case are already using Shopify as
a place to store your products. Shopify can be used as a back-end for a
headless webshop. Its a great choice for many use cases. But when we start
from scratch we would seldom choose Shopify. Care to know why? Mail us at
[support@shoppingstreet.io](mailto:support@shoppingstreet.io).

## BigCommerce

Our comments for BigCommerce are exactly the same as Shopify's. Both
options are similarly priced at approximately $30 per month. There is no
free-tier for start-ups.

## Stripe

Stripe can be used as a backend for simple shops. If you have a few
products and you don't mind having your own checkout flow, we would 
recommend to use valuable time to create a beautiful store and use [Stripe
Checkout](https://stripe.com/en-gb-nl/payments/checkout). With Stripe 
checkout you have a list of products on your stripe account and you simply
send the unique product id to Stripe and you will go through a beautifully
designed checkout form by Stripe.

We can also create a complete custom checkout flow with [Stripe Elements]
(https://stripe.com/en-gb-nl/payments/elements). Don't worry, we will 
recognise when its worth considering using just Stripe and not a dedicated
full back-end. Pros and cons will be taken into account. Also, we will 
think what to do with the customer data and payment, i.e. we will help 
organise the technical best way to do your order fulfillment.

> A typical headless e-commerce solution handles all the fundamental tasks 
> weâ€™d expect from an e-commerce website, like inventory management, a 
> shopping cart process, and a checkout process.

## Commercejs

Commercejs is currently our primary option. It offers a free tier for 2% of
your sales. It offers a subscription for $79 per month.

## Saleor

This is not a javascript back-end but a back-end build with Python. This
is a good option if your own team comes from a Python background. It offers
similar capability as Commercejs and Swell. Saleor is open-sourced and can
relatively easily be deployed to Heroku at low cost.

## Swell

Swell is similar to the other options. It offers a free tier for 2% of 
your sales. A standard subscription (the next tier) is $299 per month. This
is much more expensive than Commercejs. 

## Mailchimp Open Commerce (formerly Reaction Commerce)

This is a good outside option. It offers certain advantages and disadvantages
and if this is a good option for your use-case should be assessed on a case-
by-case basis.

## Snipcart

Another lightweight solution which may be considered is Snipcart. Again,
it is priced at 2% of your sales via Snipcart.
