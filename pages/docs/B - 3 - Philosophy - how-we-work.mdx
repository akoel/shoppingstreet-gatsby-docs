# How we work

## Onboarding

Once you have initiated a project with us you will receive:
1. A confirmation of the initial payment via Stripe (we use 
[Stripe checkout](https://stripe.com/en-gb-nl/payments/checkout))
2. An invitation for [Asana](https://asana.com).
3. An invitation for [Slack](https://slack.com/).

When you [login to Asana](https://app.asana.com/-/login) you will find a 
number of tasks. These are for us to find out in more detail what your
wishes are for the project.

Based on your answers we will plan further steps to move forward.
Typically we plan a skype call to go through the project and decide on 
any required milestones.

## Communication

### Work

Most of the communication will be on [Asana](https://app.asana.com/-/login).
Short questions and updates will typically be on Slack.

### Incremental steps

In addition to using Slack for questions and regular human contact. We
are also continuously working on providing automated messages on all our
incremental steps. This can be when we push new code to your github repo,
messages on when we deploy a new version of your website, or other steps
we take.

### E-mails

Most of the time we are working with Slack for our communication. This is
the artery for our communication. However, if you like to discuss a more
general topic, i.e. our progress, our methods, or individuals on your 
your project you will also receive the direct e-mail of our project lead. 
This person will be the bridge between technical people and its his/her
task to deliver the project and fix any problems along the way.

### Billing

You will receive a bi-weekly bill for the work we did, this will be per
e-mail on the adress you specified.

### Periodic

Based on your needs you will have a periodic videocall with our teamlead.
