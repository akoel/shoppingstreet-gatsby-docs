# Where should your site be hosted? 

Technically speaking it is not so much hosting, but Functions as a 
Service (FaaS) you are choosing between. 

>Functions as a service, FaaS, is most likely the most interacted with 
serverless product on the market. Function execution platforms really 
gained rise as more people got tired of setting up full containerized 
environments for simple code execution. The costs, overall maintenance, 
and cascading consequences of failures meant more people were looking 
for a lean context to execute one-off workers in the cloud.

> Fortunately, in front-end deployment, there are a number of hosting 
providers that are blurring the boundaries between host and FaaS provider 
which gives front-end developers an ever-expanding toolset without 
sacrificing focus. Today, the big vendors of note in this space are 
Vercel, Gatsby, and Netlify.

## Netlify

> Netlify takes a different approach to the USP by focusing on value-add. 
On top of serverless functions and edge execution, they additionally offer 
packaged auth, large object management, and form handling. These are very 
common use cases for serverless functions that are pre-made, qualifying 
Netlify as the most “FaaS platformesque” of the three.

## Vercel

> The Vercel functions USP can’t be properly explained without mentioning 
the powerhouse of frameworks that is NextJS. If you want to build a 
website with Javascript and Typescript, you won’t find a concept NextJS 
can’t handle. It is as simple as that. Being able to code API handlers, 
webhook handlers, and edge middleware – all within the same codebase as 
your website – with integrated local development, environment management, 
and deployment CLIs, Vercel is the Apple of FaaS providers. They simply 
get the ecosystem right.

## Gatsby Cloud

> Gatsby’s USP is that it is simple to integrate with. It scales well and 
is tailor-made to work with Gatsby websites. While that might sound 
limited, Gatsby single-handedly owns the brand game around static sites 
right now, with name recognition for anyone else in the static website 
space trailing by a mile. For customers dead set on Gatsby for a static 
site, Gatsby Cloud Functions will let them stay in that ecosystem without 
adding extra complexity.

## Making a choice

Making a choice between these providers can be a difficult job. We mostly
use Netlify. But based on your front-end platform, performance needs, and
pricing another platform may be a better fit. Another consideration is if 
you would like us to maintain your website or if you wish for your website
to be under complete management of your own people. 

We can always help you to do the analysis that fits your use-case best. in
most use-cases it is perfectly fine to choose Netlify.
