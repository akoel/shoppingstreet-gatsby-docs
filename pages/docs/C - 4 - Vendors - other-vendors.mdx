# What else would you need for your webshop?

** You may need several other Software as a Service providers to meet all
the required specs of your project. Required services may also depend on
the robustness you require for your website. Or the amount of
professionalism. **

## What you may need for e-commerce

1. One of our first must-haves would be a mailinglist. A tool to organise 
email would be [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com). A similar tool would be
[MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com). 
2. You may need to have chat on your website. We use [Crisp]
(https://crisp.chat/en/) because we worked with it before. But you may 
opt to use something else.
3. You may wish to do integrations with analytics tools like [Segment]
(https://segment.com) or [Google Analytics]
(https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/nl/about/analytics/).

## It doesn't stop at your website

After succesfully building a sales channel via your website you may need
another sales channel. What about an app? What about integration with 
online market places?

How about your order fulfillment? Do you need a more robust and automated
way to communicate with your shippers? Or your producers? How about your
administration? Does it fully integrate with your sales channels?

** Whatever your next steps, we will be of use to your organisation and
grow your customer engagement. **
